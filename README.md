The Play Store app data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. Actionable insights can be drawn for developers to work on and capture the Android market. Each app (row) has a category, rating, size, and more values. Another dataset contains customer reviews of the Android apps. By exploring and analyzing the data to discover key factors responsible for app engagement and success we can gain insights into the apps and their genre to invest in or work on for higher success probability.

We're diving in to figure out what makes Android apps a hit.
